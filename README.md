Linux Exploit Suggester 2
=======================

Next-generation exploit suggester based on [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)

Key Improvements Include:
* More exploits! (Last updated: July 25, 2016)
* Accurate wildcard matching. This expands the scope of searchable exploits.
* Output colorization for easy viewing.
* And more to come!

When run without arguments, this program will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, 
and return a list of possible exploits. Links to applicable exploit POCs are included. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.

Additionally, you can use the '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

This script is extremely useful for quickly finding privilege escalation vulnerabilities both on site and in exam environments.
