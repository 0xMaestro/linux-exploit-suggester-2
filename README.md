Linux Exploit Suggester 2
=======================

Next-generation exploit suggester based on [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)

Key Improvements Include:
* More exploits! (Last updated: Nov 5, 2017)
* Accurate wildcard matching. This expands the scope of searchable exploits.
* Output colorization for easy viewing.
* And more to come!

When run without arguments, this program performs a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux operating system release version, and returns a list of possible exploits. Links to applicable exploit POCs are included. Keep in mind that a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.

In addition, you can use the '-k' flag to manually enter a wildcard for the kernel/operating system release version.

This script is extremely useful for quickly finding privilege escalation vulnerabilities both in on-site and exam environments.
